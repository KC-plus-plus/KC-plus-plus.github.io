# KC's Github Page [WIP]
shhhh, you don't see anything (Work in Progress)...

I've never used github pages, github actions, any continuous integration, [yew](https://yew.rs/), [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/), or anything wasm before, *and* I hardly know rust. But I managed to set this up. It might not be the best, but man am I proud of myself.

I can even get a status badge! --> [![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/KC-plus-plus/KC-plus-plus.github.io/actions/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KC-plus-plus/KC-plus-plus.github.io/actions/workflows/build_and_deploy.yml) <-- Look at that! So cool! I've never had a markdown badge for anything before.

Big thanks to this [minimal template](https://github.com/yewstack/yew-trunk-minimal-template) that help me get up and running with yew and trunk and an equal thanks to this [github actions project](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) that helped with setting up my github actions to push to the gh pages branch.
